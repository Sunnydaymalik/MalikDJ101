BEATS FOLDER - ADD YOUR AUDIO FILES HERE

To add your beats to the website:

1. Place your MP3 files in this folder
2. Update the beatsData array in script.js with your beat information
3. Make sure the audioUrl and downloadUrl paths match your file names

Example file structure:
- ashes.mp3
- midnight-echo.mp3
- golden-hour.mp3
- neon-dreams.mp3
- shadow-dance.mp3
- serenity.mp3

For testing purposes, you can use any MP3 files you have, or download royalty-free music for testing.

The website will work even without audio files - you'll just see "Error loading audio file" when trying to play.
